# PHYSICS SIMULATOR

C++ CLI simulator of linear motions, namely, uniform and non-uniform ones.

It also features both an equation-solving class and an operation-solver class,
which are used to get the unknown variables of the motion, just as a physics-problem.

I want to add new motions (like falling motions) on the future, but I'm happy with the current result.

Originally, it was meant to be much simpler and just a way to make current-time-using functions
and use them in a project, but I kept adding more and more features until I reach this result
